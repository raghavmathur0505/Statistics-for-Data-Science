About the Project:

1) Built a “reasonably good” linear model for the given data by taking PSA level as the response variable. 
2) Justified all the choices you make in building the model. 

3) Verified the model assumptions and also distinguish between quantitative and qualitative variables. 

4) Used the final model to predict the PSA level for a patient whose
predictors are at the sample means of the variables.

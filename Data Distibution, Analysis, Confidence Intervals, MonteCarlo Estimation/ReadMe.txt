Dataset Description:

This dataset contains one measurement of systolic blood pressure (in mmHg) made by each of two methods—a finger method and an arm method—from the same 200 patients.

About the Project:

	1) Performed an exploratory analysis of the data by examining the distributions of the measurements from the two methods using boxplots
	2) Used histograms and QQ plots to examine the shapes of the two distributions.
	3) Constructed an appropriate 95% confidence interval for the difference in the means of the two methods.
	4) Computed the coverage probability of a confidence interval using Monte Carlo simulation, and examined how close the probability is  to the nominal confidence level
